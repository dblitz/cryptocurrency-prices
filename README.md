Notes:
"We also observed that Random Forests gave us a better accuracy rate as compared to GLM.
This is because RFs use nonparametric decision trees, so outliers and linear separability of the data are not concerns." http://cs229.stanford.edu/proj2014/Isaac%20Madan,%20Shaurya%20Saluja,%20Aojia%20Zhao,Automated%20Bitcoin%20Trading%20via%20Machine%20Learning%20Algorithms.pdf)
